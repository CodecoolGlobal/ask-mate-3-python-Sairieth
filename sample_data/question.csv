I could easy managing the loading order with wp_enqueue_script so first I load jquery then I load booklet so everything is fine.

BUT in my theme i also using jquery via webpack so the loading order is now following:

jquery
booklet
app.js (bundled file with webpack, including jquery)

hope it works this time. maybe this time.",images/image1.png
